# The code files work collectively to solve for apogee prediction and aerodynamic modelling of the rocket
# abhyuday_ork_solver consists of the mathematical model & simulation details to solve for the dynamics of rocket
# aerodynamic_char_test gives flexibility to change system geometry/nature dependent aerodynamic characteristics and test for changes
# barrowman_test file consists of barrowman equations used to calculate centre of pressure of the rocket
# Location of COP determines restorning normal & stability caliber of rocket during flight
# rocket_test file is used to plot the rocket's current schematic
